# process-automation :gear:	:snake:
Repository for automation scripts written in Python using openpyxl, pyautogui, Selenium and many other libraries.

I developed these automations while working at Sicredi IntegraÃ§Ã£o PR/SC, and they have allowed me to make this public repository after removing any sensible information from the code. 

I was learning automation with Python while developing these scripts, so I tried to enforce object-oriented programming, DRY and file organization to some extent. 

During my time there, I've also implemented Agile methods, introduced Kanban (with Trello) for task tracking and management to the team, and worked closely with different departments (Finance, Operations, Marketing, Human Resources) to evaluate the requirements and constraints of new automation projects. 

Finally, I also worked with low-code platforms such as UiPath, but I want to get *as far as I can* from lowcode/nocode in the future. :skull::skull::skull: 


Topics covered in these scripts:

- :love_letter: File manipulation: copying from and to files, creating directories, acessing and processing data from different formats (.csv, .xlsm, .txt. .env)
- ðŸ’¬ GUI manipulation: controlling mouse and keyboard, automating Windows apps, automating the web, dealing with selectors and image recognition, sending emails
- :space_invader: Web scraping: automating browsers, interacting with DOM, searching for dynamic selectors + regex, web scraping using Selenium


Though I know it's not the most DRY code and could definitely use several improvements, I'm glad I got to learn so much while developing this, especially the web scraping part and adapting the code for deployment on other machines.
